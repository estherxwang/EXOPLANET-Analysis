# EXOPLANET-Analysis repro

This repo contains an R project file for my paper "Continuous Habitable Zones: Discovering the True Alien Earth". In the paper, I discussed, analyzed and visualized the distribution of the data set pulled out from the exoplanet catalogue.

This repo contains three folders: inputs, outputs, and scripts. Inputs:

    Data: data from the exoplanet database

Outputs:

    Exploratory analysis
    Paper: R Markdown, a pdf version, and a complete bibliography

Scripts:

    Import data
    Data simulation
     

How to generate the paper

    Open EXOPLANET-Analysis.Rproj in RStudio
    Install libraries using install.packages() if necessary
    Run 01_Import_Data.R
    Run Final-Paper.Rmd
