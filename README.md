# Data
The data I used for study and research is collected by NASA, exoplanet database. The data is a survey that aims to analyze the properties of exoplanets. All the data I obtained are not cleaned and needs to be further manipulated.

# Overview of Paper
In the paper, I discussed, analyzed and visualized the distribution of the data set pulled out from the exoplanet survey. Methodology of the survey was inspected and then conducted an analysis of the best features based on different segmentation of the respondents. Alongside, the weakness of the survey and the next steps are provided in the paper for future improvement of the survey. We attatched the reference at the very end.
