Based on the location of the main volcanic peak towards NE, the volcanic feature is geologically termed as Parasitic Volcanic cone. Parasitic
volcanic cones are smaller volcanic cones erupting along the flanks or sides of the main volcanic cones, away from the central vent of the main cone
The central vent is towards the volcanic peak in NE and hence, these small cones are parasitic cones. The snow-covered peak towards NE is a
dormant stratovolcano. The volcano lies in the Kamchatka Peninsula and the cluster of volcanoes is called Mt Kamen.
These volcanoes are formed on the Kamchatka Peninsula due to its vicinity to the Pacific Ring of Fire and nearby Kurile-Kamchatka Trench. While
most of volcanoes are dormant, some of them are active.
